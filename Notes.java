		 	This is the main block of code. The program will start from the main method.
		 	The word public means it is accessible by other classes in the program. 
		 	The word static keyword will make a method to become a static method. 
		 	The static method is not belonged to any object of the class. 
		 	You can access a static method without creating an instance of the class. 
		 	The word void means it returns nothing.
		 	String [] args is called argument which is used to pass value (s) to the program.

		Object:
			
		/*   1. Objects : Objects have state & behaviors. 
		 * 
		 * Example : Dog
		 * 
		 * State - Color, Name, breed etc
		 * Behavior - Wragging tail, braking, eating, sleeping etc
		 * 
		 * Syntax : className object=new className();
		 * 
		 * An Object is an instance of a class.

		Class:
		
		/* 2. A class can be a template/Blueprint that describes the behavior/state. 
		 * 		All class names first letter should be upper case. 
		 *  
		 *  	Ex: class MyFirstJavaClass();

		Method:
		
		/* 3. Method : A method is basically a behavior where logics are written, 
		 * data is manipulated & all the actions are executed. 
		 * 
		 * Syntax : Modifier Returntype nameOfMethod (Parameter list);

		 Return Types:
			 
			 /*The type of value/object which a java method returns is a return type. 
					 If method return nothing then it must be void.

		 Java Modifiers:
			 
			/* Access Modifiers: Default, public, protected, private.
			 
			 Non-access modifiers: Final, abstract, strictfp.

		Type Casting:
			
			/* Type casting is used to convert an object or variable of one type into another. 
			 * 
			 * 	Syntax: dataType variableName = (dataType) variableToConvert;
			 * 
			 * Notes
			 *   There are two casting directions: narrowing (larger to smaller type) and widening (smaller to larger type). 
			 *   Widening can be done automatically (for example, int to double), but narrowing must be done explicitly (like double to int).
